      <h2>1. Business Description</h2>
      <p>
        oVRcome operates within the <strong>healthcare industry</strong>, specializing in the integration of virtual reality
        (VR) technology into mental health treatment. The company provides VR-based exposure therapy and relaxation training
        to help clients overcome anxiety, phobias, and other mental health challenges through immersive therapeutic environments.

      <h2>2. My Role in the Company</h2>
      <p>
        As a <strong>counselor/therapist</strong> at oVRcome, I work directly with clients to assess their needs,
        guide them through VR therapy sessions, and track their progress over time. I collaborate with a multidisciplinary
        team to design customized treatment plans and ensure that each client receives safe, evidence-based, and effective
        therapeutic experiences.

      <h2>3. Ethical Issue</h2>
      <p>
        One ethical issue that could arise in my role is the <strong>protection of client confidentiality</strong> during
        virtual sessions. Because VR therapy involves digital platforms and sensitive personal data, there is a risk of
        unauthorized access or accidental sharing of confidential health information. Maintaining privacy and informed
        consent is crucial to uphold ethical standards in counseling.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Client mental health records and VR session data could be exposed if the system is hacked or improperly secured.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing and Social Engineering:</strong> Cybercriminals could impersonate staff or IT support to gain access to sensitive systems or client data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use multi-factor authentication and strong passwords for all logins.</li>
        <li>Encrypt client data both in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li>Provide staff training on recognizing phishing and social engineering attempts.</li>
        <li>Regularly update VR software and cybersecurity tools to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Follow HIPAA and other data protection regulations to maintain client confidentiality and system integrity.</li>
      </ul>
