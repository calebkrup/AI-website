    <h2>Why my Christian Belief Matters  </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Christianity is the belief that guides every value I own. It is who I am today, it is why i believe in honesty, discipline, and integrity as 3/4 beliefs that I whole strongly onto. </li>
      <li>I've always been involved in a Christian community but truly was not a part of it until I reached college where I realized how much I did not understand. I was like a wave of the sea tossing and being led by the wind.</li>
      <li>If I were to no longer adhere to the value of Christianity I would lose who I am. Losing Christianity would be like me losing my glasses. I no longer can see the world clearly, I would lose sight of everything valuable.</li> 
  </ol>
 </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why My Integrity Belief Matter</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Integrity shows who you really are. Whether I am by myself or in a crowd of people I want to act and say the same things. I don't want to change who I am or make bad decisions based on who I am around.</li>
      <li>In my future job as a counselor I will be given plenty of advice and I want to be giving the best advice known.</li>
      <li>I have hidden behind a facade for a long time about many different things and it really left me broken and alone. I want to have integrity because whether I am alone or not people still value me.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>
<section>
  <h2>Why My Discipline Belief Matters</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Discipline has defined much of my life. I have seen what it is like to lack discipline and it can destroy a man. Discipline can often display what a man truly desires and I want to be a man that can show discipline over mind and body. </li>
    <li>It's important for me to continue working on my discipline to show that I can be a strong leader for my future family as that is a strong desire in my core. I do not want to be a dad or husband that is not able to lead his household well.</li>
    <li>I have seen what it is like to not be in control of one's own body and it can steer many away from a healthy life. The lack of discipline that one man can have truly does impact many.</li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Why My Honesty Belief Matters</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Honesty plays a part in all of my adult life as I am pursuing counseling. This field will require myself to be fully prepared to love and treat those who need help with respect and Honesty as I want to be a trusted person in their lives.</li>
    <li>As I have stated that I am Christian which flows much into this view on honesty. From the heart the mouth speaks is a great piece of scripture that explains just how I have seen others speak what they truly feel and I want to be a man that speaks life into others.</li>
    <li>In my experience, I have seen many men and women lie very easily and it devalues so much of what's said. I lose trust in it, I want to be a man that can be trusted and Honesty of word is one of the most important areas that it applies to.</li>
